# VPC Deployment using Infrastructure-as-Code(IaC) - Terraform

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a service that lets you launch AWS resources n a logicallys isolated virtual network that you define. 
It gives you control over your virtual networking environment, which includes a selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets and configuration of route tables and network gateways.
This project demonstrates how this architecture can be achieved using infrastructure as code(Terraform). We will end up modularising this code for re-use configuration in the future.
A break down of the resources deployed in this project is listed below:
